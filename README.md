This repository contains the code of the new *openSenseMap* frontend running at [https://beta.opensensemap.org](https://beta.opensensemap.org).

Originally, the *openSenseMap* was built as part of the bachelor thesis of [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics, University of MÃ¼nster). Between 2016 and 2022 development was partly funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the projets senseBox and senseBox Pro. This version has been developed by [@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) and [@freds-dev](https://github.com/freds-dev).
