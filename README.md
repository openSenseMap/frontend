This repository contains the code of the new _openSenseMap_ frontend running at
[https://beta.opensensemap.org](https://beta.opensensemap.org).

Originally, the _openSenseMap_ was built as part of the bachelor thesis of
[@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) at the ifgi (Institute for Geoinformatics,
University of MÃ¼nster). Between 2016 and 2022 development was partly funded by
the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the projets senseBox and
senseBox Pro. This version has been developed by
[@mpfeil](https://github.com/mpfeil) and
[@freds-dev](https://github.com/freds-dev).

## Project setup

If you do need to set the project up locally yourself, feel free to follow these
instructions:

### System Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.0.0
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) >= 8.18.0
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) >= 2.38.0
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) >= 27.0.0

### Variables

You can configure the API endpoint and/or map tiles using the following
environmental variables:

| ENV                 | Default value                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| OSEM_API_URL        | https://api.testing.opensensemap.org |
| DATABASE_URL        | <YOUR_POSTGRES_URL>                  |
| MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN | <YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN>           |

You can create a copy of `.env.example`, rename it to `.env` and set the values.

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/openSenseMap/frontend`
2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run docker` to start the docker container running your local
   postgres DB
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the local server

### Debugging

For users of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) there is a
[`launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) containing two options to debug the
application:

1. Debug
   - Starts the development task (`npm run dev`) and attaches to process
1. Attach
   - Use when you have started the development task elsewhere already
   - Attaches to an existing task
   - You will be prompted with running tasks. Depending on your setup you may
     need to try a few until you find the correct one. Hint: Look out for the
     arguments of the tasks and choose the one that contains `tsx watch`

Debugging the application will allow you to set breakpoints and step through the
code. Additionally, you may set
[logpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_logpoints)
to eliminate the need for `console.log` in your code for debugging purposes.
